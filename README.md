# School_District_Analysis

### Using Pandas, we were able to read, import, clean and analyze data from a large csv file. Using pandas Data Frames we were able to clean data from duplicates and changed data that was labeled as a string into an integer so we could work it into equations. We were able to see the reading score from a specific grade at a specific school. We were also able to compare the grades between Public and Charter schools. Looking at this we see an improvement in math scores at the Charter schools but the average scores for reading are the same between both school types. 

### We could also manipulate the data to show us the budget of each school. We can also look at the amounts of each grade generation for each specific school!

### Working in the code, I got caught up in some syntax errors while writing the conditional code to search for grade 9. The example code from the earlier workbook showed a reference to find text with "paranthesees" around the text. I had enclosed these around a number for 9. I was hung up on this error for a while before realizing the fix was removing the parenthasees as wrapping a number in paranthasees changes it's type. Overcoming this hurdle I was able to finish the rest of the project quite quickly. I really appreciate how fast and simply we can find answers to our questions in Pandas using Jupyter notebook!
